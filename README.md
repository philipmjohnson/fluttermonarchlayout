# Flutter layout problem

I have encountered a puzzling layout inconsistency involving the Wrap, Stack, Chip, and Positioned widgets and I am hoping that the Flutter community can help me resolve it. I have a created a simple Flutter app at <https://github.com/philipmjohnson/fluttermonarchlayout> (based on the default Counter app) that illustrates the problem.

My question: How can I get my "Badges" to lay out consistently across all platforms? 

## Expected behavior

To start, here are two images from two platforms that show the desired layout:

### Chrome

### Monarch (iPhone 13 Pro)

This image is a screenshot from the [Monarch](https://monarchapp.io/) UI development environment, which is set to emulate the iPhone 13 Pro platform:

## Unexpected behavior

Now, here are two images that illustrate two layout problems from the same codebase:
1. The star Icons are now incorrectly positioned within the Chip widget.
2. There is additional padding between the two "rows" of the Wrapped widgets.

### iOS Simulator (iPhone13Pro)

The iOS Simulator does not display the same layout as Monarch, even though both are set to emulate the iPhone 13 Pro platform:

### Android simulator (Pixel 6 Pro)

## Suspect Code

The relevant code to create the "Badge" is in [badge_icon.dart](https://github.com/philipmjohnson/fluttermonarchlayout/blob/main/lib/badge_icon.dart). 

The code to create the wrapped list of Badges is in [wrapped_badges.dart](https://github.com/philipmjohnson/fluttermonarchlayout/blob/main/lib/wrapped_badges.dart).
